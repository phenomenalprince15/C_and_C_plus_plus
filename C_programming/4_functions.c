/*
You can also create your own functions.
A function:
• is a block of code that performs a specific task
• is reusable
• makes a program easier to test
• can be modified without changing the calling program

By default, arguments are passed by value, which means that a copy of data is given to the parameters of the called function. The actual variable isn't passed into the function, so it won't change.
Arguments passed to a function are matched to parameters by position. Therefore, the first argument is passed to the first parameter, the second to the second parameter, and so on.

Static variables have a local scope but are not destroyed when a function is exited. Therefore, a static variable retains its value for the life of the program and can be accessed every time the function is re-entered.
