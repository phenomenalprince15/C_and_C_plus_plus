/*
The C preprocessor uses the # directives to make substitutions in program source code before compilation.
For example, the line #include <stdio.h> is replaced by the contents of the stdio.h header file before a program is compiled.

* Preprocessor directives and their uses:

#include Including header files.

#define, #undef Defining and undefining macros.

#ifdef, #ifndef, #if, #else, #elif, #endif Conditional compilation.

#pragma Implementation and compiler specific.

#error, #warning Output an error or warning message An error halts compilation.
